"""You are an expert chess player. Here is the position in FEN format:
{{ FEN }}

Legal moves: {{ legal_moves_uci }}

Board looks like this right now
{{ board_utf }}

Select the best move. Keep your thinking to 2 sentences or less, then output your chosen move.

CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Your final answer MUST be exactly two XML tags: `<think>…</think>` followed by `<uci_move>…</uci_move>`.
2. The move inside `<uci_move>` must be a single legal UCI string taken from `legal_moves_uci` with no quotes, spaces, or commentary.
3. Do not include SQL, tables, markdown, code fences, or any other prose outside the two tags. Violating this format means you instantly lose the game.

An example of a valid move for this position is <uci_move>{{ first_legal_move }}</uci_move>.

Format:
<think>brief thinking (2 sentences max)</think>
<uci_move>your_move</uci_move>"""
